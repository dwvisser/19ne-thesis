Many astronomical phenomena require detailed knowledge of nuclear reactions
for adequate γexplanation. For example, it is well known that the sun, the
source of nearly all the energy which fuels our society, is itself fueled by
the fusing of hydrogen into helium. Observations of solar neutrinos at
Kamioka, Japan
[<a href="../bibliography/#fukuda">Fukuda, Fukuda et al. 2001</a>] and in
Sudbury, Ontario
[<a href="../bibliography/#ahmed">Ahmad, Allen et al. 2001</a>] have confirmed
this fact beautifully.

Balancing gravitational pressure with radiative pressure produced by the
heating of their interiors by nuclear reactions stabilizes stars like our sun.
Put another way, the stellar matter (mostly hydrogen) is squeezed to such high
temperatures (average energy) and densities that nuclei are able to overcome
their electrostatic repulsion and fuse with one another. The most typical
pathway for this is called the pp-I chain:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td>p(p,e<sup>+</sup>ν)d(p,γ)³He(³He,2p)<sup>4</sup>He</td>
		<th rowspan="2">(1.1)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Net Result: 4<sup>1</sup>H → <sup>4</sup>He + 2e<sup>+</sup> + 2ν
			+ 26.73 MeV</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In our sun, two other sequences, the pp-II and pp-III chains, are responsible
for another 14% of the fusions. The amounts of energy lost to the neutrinos,
which escape without interacting, differ slightly among the chains.

		boxes represent the valley of β-stability. CNO-I is the dominant
		cycle, while the other numbered CNO cycles are additional side cycles
		through which processing may occur. Hot CNO is a process that produces
		energy at a greater rate at higher temperatures away from the valley
		of β-stability. The rate of energy generation in hot CNO reaches its
		maximum at approximately 100 MK at which point it is limited by the
		waiting points [Weischer Görres at al. 1999].</caption>

A second important fusion process is burning throught the CNO cycles.
