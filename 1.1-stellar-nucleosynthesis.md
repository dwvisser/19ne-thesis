Many astronomical phenomena require detailed knowledge of nuclear reactions
for adequate γexplanation. For example, it is well known that the sun, the
source of nearly all the energy which fuels our society, is itself fueled by
the fusing of hydrogen into helium. Observations of solar neutrinos at
Kamioka, Japan
[<a href="../bibliography/#fukuda">Fukuda, Fukuda et al. 2001</a>] and in
Sudbury, Ontario
[<a href="../bibliography/#ahmed">Ahmad, Allen et al. 2001</a>] have confirmed
this fact beautifully.

Balancing gravitational pressure with radiative pressure produced by the
heating of their interiors by nuclear reactions stabilizes stars like our sun.
Put another way, the stellar matter (mostly hydrogen) is squeezed to such high
temperatures (average energy) and densities that nuclei are able to overcome
their electrostatic repulsion and fuse with one another. The most typical
pathway for this is called the pp-I chain:
