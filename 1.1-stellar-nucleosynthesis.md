Many astronomical phenomena require detailed knowledge of nuclear reactions
for adequate explanation. For example, it is well known that the sun, the
source of nearly all the energy which fuels our society, is itself fueled by
the fusing of hydrogen into helium. Observations of solar neutrinos at
Kamioka, Japan
[<a href="../bibliography/#fukuda">Fukuda, Fukuda et al. 2001</a>] and in
Sudbury, Ontario
[<a href="../bibliography/#ahmed">Ahmad, Allen et al. 2001</a>] have confirmed
this fact beautifully.
