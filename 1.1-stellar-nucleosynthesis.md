Many astronomical phenomena require detailed knowledge of nuclear reactions
for adequate explanation. For example, it is well known that the sun, the
source of nearly all the energy which fuels our society, is itself fueled by
the fusing of hydrogen into helium. Observations of solar neutrinos at
Kamioka, Japan
[<a href="../bibliography/#fukuda">Fukuda, Fukuda et al. 2001</a>] and in
Sudbury, Ontario
[<a href="../bibliography/#ahmed">Ahmad, Allen et al. 2001</a>] have confirmed
this fact beautifully.

Balancing gravitational pressure with radiative pressure produced by the
heating of their interiors by nuclear reactions stabilizes stars like our sun.
Put another way, the stellar matter (mostly hydrogen) is squeezed to such high
temperatures (average energy) and densities that nuclei are able to overcome
their electrostatic repulsion and fuse with one another. The most typical
pathway for this is called the pp-I chain:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td>p(p,e<sup>+</sup>ν)d(p,γ)³He(³He,2p)<sup>4</sup>He</td>
		<th rowspan="2">(1.1)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Net Result: 4¹H → <sup>4</sup>He + 2e<sup>+</sup> + 2ν +26.73
			MeV</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In our sun, two other sequences, the pp-II and pp-III chains, are responsible
for another 14% of the fusions. The amounts of energy lost to the neutrinos,
which escape without interacting, differ slightly among the chains.

A second important fusion process is burning through the CNO cycles. This
process catalyzes the fusion using existing stable carbon and nitrogen in the
star. Mostly it burns through the CNO-I cycle:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td>¹²C(p,γ)¹³N(e<sup>+</sup>ν)¹³C(p,γ)<sup>14</sup>N(p,γ)<sup>15</sup>O(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>15</sup>N(p,α)¹²C</td>
		<a name="eqn1.2"><th rowspan="2">(1.2)</th></a>
	</tr>
</table>

At low temperatures and densities (T < 50 MK, ρ < 100 g/cm³), the rate of this
cycle is limited by the <span class="nowrap"><sup>14</sup>N(p,γ)</span>
reaction <cite>[<a href="../bibliography/#weischer">Weischer Görres at al.
1999</a>]</cite>. For approximately one cycle in 1000, <sup>15</sup>N captures
a proton instead <span class="correction">of</span> cycling back to ¹²C in the
CNO-II cycle:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td><sup>14</sup>N(p,γ)<sup>15</sup>O(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>15</sup>N(p,γ)<sup>16</sup>O(p,γ)<sup>17</sup>F(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>17</sup>O(p,α)<sup>14</sup>N</td>
		<a name="eqn1.3"><th>(1.3)</th></a>
	</tr>
</table>

There is some additional leakage out of CNO-II to the nucleus <sup>18</sup>F
via the CNO-III cycle:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td><sup>17</sup>O(p,γ)<sup>18</sup>F(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>18</sup>O(p,α)<sup>15</sup>N</td>
		<a name="eqn1.4"><th>(1.4)</th></a>
	</tr>
</table>

For about one cycle in 150, the <sup>18</sup>O may capture a proton instead.
If the resulting <sup>19</sup>F cycles back to <sup>16</sup>O via (p,α), this
is called the CNO-IV cycle. Alternatively, the <sup>19</sup>F may capture a
proton into <sup>20</sup>Ne upon which protons may be converted into alphas by
the faster Ne-Na cycle. The ratio of the
<span class="nowrap"><sup>19</sup>F(p,γ)</span> rate to the
<span class="nowrap"><sup>19</sup>F(p,α)</span> rate is small and very
uncertain <cite>[<a href="../bibliography/#weischer">Weischer Görres at al.
1999</a>]</cite>.

At high enough temperatures (e.g.<span class="correction">,</span> 150 MK at
densities of 100 g∙cm<sup>-3</sup>), the CNO cycles are turned into the
"hotCNO" cycle. In the hotCNO cycle, proton capture proceeds to the drip line
<cite>[<a href="../bibliography/#weischer">Weischer Görres at al.
1999</a>]</cite>:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td>I: ¹²C(p,γ)¹³N(p,γ)<sup>14</sup>O(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>14</sup>N(p,γ)<sup>15</sup>O(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>15</sup>N(p,α)¹²C</td>
		<a name="eqn1.5"><th rowspan="2">(1.5)</th></a>

	<tr>
		<td>II: <sup>16</sup>O(p,γ)<sup>17</sup>F(p,γ)<sup>18</sup>Ne(e<sup>+</sup>ν)<sup>18</sup>F(p,α)<sup>15</sup>O</td>
	</tr>

The hotCNO cycle is the primary energy generation process in novae. Note that
the rate at which this cycle operates is limited by the
β<sup>+</sup>-lifetimes of the <sup>14</sup>O (τ = 1.70 minutes) and
<sup>15</sup>O (τ = 2.94 minutes) nuclei. These lifetimes, unlike the capture
reaction rates, are independent of temperature. Any point in a nuclear burning
process where β-decay is the dominant path is called a "waiting point". The
wiating point nuclei <sup>14</sup>O, <sup>15</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>F shown
in <a href="#eqn1.2">(1.2)</a>, <a href="#eqn1.3">(1.3)</a>,
<a href="#eqn1.4">(1.4)</a> and <a href="#eqn1.5">(1.5)</a> may have important
roles in explosive nucleosynthesis. We will focus on the latter two:
<sup>15</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>F.

One proposed alternative pathe to the A>18 region is the alpha-capture
reaction on <sup>15</sup>O. One of the purposes of the measurement described
in this document is to constrain the possible values for this reaction rate.
The rate of <span class="nowrap"><sup>18</sup>F(p,α)</span> is one factor
determining the temperatures and densities at which the hotCNO cycle may
operate. In novae, proton-induced reaction on <sup>18</sup>F play an
astronomically observable role described in more detail below
