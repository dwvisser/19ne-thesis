Many astronomical phenomena require detailed knowledge of nuclear reactions
for adequate explanation. For example, it is well known that the sun, the
source of nearly all the energy which fuels our society, is itself fueled by
the fusing of hydrogen into helium. Observations of solar neutrinos at
Kamioka, Japan
[<a href="../bibliography/#fukuda">Fukuda, Fukuda et al. 2001</a>] and in
Sudbury, Ontario
[<a href="../bibliography/#ahmed">Ahmad, Allen et al. 2001</a>] have confirmed
this fact beautifully.

Balancing gravitational pressure with radiative pressure produced by the
heating of their interiors by nuclear reactions stabilizes stars like our sun.
Put another way, the stellar matter (mostly hydrogen) is squeezed to such high
temperatures (average energy) and densities that nuclei are able to overcome
their electrostatic repulsion and fuse with one another. The most typical
pathway for this is called the pp-I chain:

<table class="equation">
	<tr>
		<td>p(p,e<sup>+</sup>ν)d(p,γ)³He(³He,2p)⁴He</td>
		<th rowspan="2">(1.1)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Net Result: 4¹H → ⁴He + 2e<sup>+</sup> + 2ν	+ 26.73 MeV</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In our sun, two other sequences, the pp-II and pp-III chains, are responsible
for another 14% of the fusions. The amounts of energy lost to the neutrinos,
which escape without interacting, differ slightly among the chains.

A second important fusion process is burning through the CNO cycles. This
process catalyzes the fusion using existing stable carbon and nitrogen in the
star. Mostly it burns through the CNO-I cycle:

	<tr>
		<td>¹²C(p,γ)¹³N(e<sup>+</sup>ν)¹³C(p,γ)¹⁴N(p,γ)¹⁵O(e<sup>+</sup>ν)¹⁵N(p,α)¹²C</td>
		<th rowspan="2">(1.2)</th>
	</tr>
