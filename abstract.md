# ABSTRACT

Reactions through resonances in <sup>19</sup>Ne are thought to be
important participants in explosive stellar environments. 
<sup>15</sup>O(α,γ) has been suggested as a possible pathway out of the hotCNO
"bottleneck" to processes that generate more energy. At the lower temperatures
and densities in novae, in particular oxygen-neon novae, <span class="nowrap">
<sup>18</sup>F(p,γ)</span> and <span class="nowrap"><sup>18</sup>F(p,α)</span>
play a role that is important in γ-ray astronomy. The amount of <sup>18</sup>F
remaining in a nova's expanding envelope of ashes depends sensitively on the
rates of these two reactions.

It is difficult to directly measure astrophysical reaction rates, even at the
relatively high energies of novae (~500 keV) and x-ray bursters (~1-2 MeV).
For the reactions considered here, the participant nuclei ar radioactive, 
creating more challenges. At the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory, indirect
methods are employed for measuring astrophysical reaction rates. Nuclei are
populated through alternate reactions, and the properties of their states are
measured. For this study, <sup>19</sup>Ne was populated via the
<span class="nowrap"><sup>19</sup>F(³He,t)</span> reaction with a 25 MeV
<sup>3</sup>He beam incident on 80 μg/cm² of CaF<sub>2</sub> deposited on 10
μg/cm² of carbon. A large area segmented silicon array, the Yale LampShade
Array (YLSA), was assembled for the purpose of measuring proton- and α-decays
from astrophysically relevant states in <sup>19</sup>Ne. The reacction rates
are linearly dependent on the branching ratios to these channels. YLSA
detected the decay particles at backward lab angles in coincidence with
tritons at θ=0°. Angular distributions were fit to the coincidence data, and 
integrated in order to determine branching ratios to the proton and alpha
channels.

These results were compared to similar efforts to measure branching ratios
using different reactions and techniques, and also to a previous
<span class="nowrap">(³He,t)</span> effort that used different instruments. In
addition to standard statistical methods, a Bayesian technique was employed
for averaging the data due to the physical constraints on allowed values.
