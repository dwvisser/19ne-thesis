# Abstract

<div class="text">

Reactions through resonances in <sup>19</sup>Ne are thought to be
important participants in explosive stellar environments. 
<sup>15</sup>O(α,γ) has been suggested as a possible pathway out of the hotCNO
"bottleneck" to processes that generate more energy. At the lower temperatures
and densities in novae, in particular oxygen-neon novae, <sup>18</sup>F(p,γ)
and <sup>18</sup>F(p,α) play a role that is important in γ-ray astronomy. The
amount of <sup>18</sup>F remaining in a nova's expanding envelope of ashes
depends sensitively on the rates of these two reactions.
