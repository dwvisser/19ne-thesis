# ABSTRACT

Reactions through resonances in <sup>19</sup>Ne are thought to be
important participants in explosive stellar environments. 
<sup>15</sup>O(α,γ) has been suggested as a possible pathway out of the hotCNO
"bottleneck" to processes that generate more energy. At the lower temperatures
and densities in novae, in particular oxygen-neon novae, <span class="nowrap">
<sup>18</sup>F(p,γ)</span> and <span class="nowrap"><sup>18</sup>F(p,α)</span>
play a role that is important in γ-ray astronomy. The amount of <sup>18</sup>F
remaining in a nova's expanding envelope of ashes depends sensitively on the
rates of these two reactions.

It is difficult to directly measure astrophysical reaction rates, even at the
relatively high energies of novae (~500 keV)
