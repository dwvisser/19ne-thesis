§1.2 White dwarves and novae
============================

<blockquote>
<p>White dwarf matter is so highly compressed that a bowling ball filled with
	the stuff would tip the scales at over a thousand tons–about the weight of
	a small ocean liner.

In normal stars, the relationship between pressure, density and temperature is
well-described by the ideal gas law [[Rolfs and Rodney
1988]](../bibliography/#rolfs). This relationship holds as long as nuclear
fuel remains to provide heat and energy. Once the fuel runs out, however, the
star no longer is able to support itself, and its material then collapses.

Chandrasekhar showed that if the remaining mass is less than 1.4 solar masses,
the object may be supported from further collapse by electrons behaving as a
Fermi gas [[Chandrasekhar 1939]](../bibliography/#chandrasekhar). The
electrons in a star are the most numerous particles, especially in a white
dwarf. White dwarves are primarily ashes from the later stages of nuclear
burning, such as carbon, oxygen, neon and magnesium.

As fermions, electrons are governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which
says that no two identical fermions may inhabit the same quantum state. In a
white dwarf, the electrons have filled up all available quantum states up to
the Fermi energy. A solar mass white dwarf has a radius of approximately 8000
km (only slightly higher than the earth), making thes objects very dense
(~10<sup>6</sup> g⋅cm<sup>-3</sup>) [[Rolfs and Rodney
1988]](../bibliography/#rolfs).
