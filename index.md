Format Notes
------------
As I've transcribed my thesis to this site from the original published
version, I have tried to format it similarly to the original. However, I do
occasionally make small corrections. I've highlighted these with
<span class="correction">distinct formatting</span>.

For now, some browsers may incorrectly render equations. This is likely due
to using HTTPS to access the pages. Certain resources are being loaded with
non-secure HTTP. See [Mixed
Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent)
for details. The solution is to use the `http://` form of the URL rather
than the `https://` form. If you are using [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) in Chrome, going to
"Incognito Mode" will usually allow you to load HTTP pages. If you
are using HTTPS Everywhere in Firefox, it is possible to create an exception
for `*.github.io`.
