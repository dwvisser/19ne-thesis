# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank many people, without whom this work would have been much
more difficult. At the top of the list, of course, is Peter Parker. I cannot
imagine having a more supportive or effective mentor. Beyond his extensive
knowledge of the field, Peter's great strength as an advisor is his ability to
accomodate the different working styles of those he supervises. I believe this
is something that cannot be taught.
