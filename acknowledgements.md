# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank many people, without whom this work would have been much
more difficult. At the top of the list, of course, is Peter Parker. I cannot
imagine having a more supportive or effective mentor. Beyond his extensive
knowledge of the field, Peter's great strength as an advisor is his ability to
accomodate the different working styles of those he supervises. I believe this
is something that cannot be taught.

I am very grateful to the succession of post-doctoral researchers who have
worked in our research group for all of their help and guidance. Ken Swartz
eased my transition into the life of a graduate researcher. The focal plane
detector works today largely because of his efforts. By creating Jam, he gave
me the chance to feed the code-hacker monkey that lives on my back and do
important work for our research at the same time. After he left to work in
industry, he allowed me to appreciate what our west coast has to offer by
hosting a couple of my vacations. William Bradfield-Handler arrived at Yale
with a freshly minted Ph.D. from the U.K. He proceeded to kick-start the
"coincidence project" and organized all the major hardware purchasing and
design. He also made certain that we all had fun while we were doing our work.
It is because of him that I learned how to get properly drunk and party all
night (well, most of it, anyway) in Edinburgh. Jac Caggiano was Will's
successor, and was no less valuable in making sure that my experiment was
pulled off succsessfully. He has definitely taught me patience in the face of
electronics debugging, and also the importance of using appropriate tools for
data analysis. I'll miss his ability to produce an appropriate quote from "The
Simpsons" for any situation.

Of course, I am indebted to all the graduate students who have worked with me.
As Peter has often stated, we all teach each other as much as any faculty
member. For that, and for their hard work on experiments (especially the 
night shifts), I am grateful to Alan Chen, Rachel Lewis and Anuj Parikh. I
don't know what's going to happen to social life in the lab when Rachel
leaves.

The support staff of WNSL are invaluable. Thomas Barker, Richard Wagner and
Craig Miller all created portions of the physical and electronic
infrastructure of YLSA. Mary Anne Schulz, Karen Defelice and their assistants
have made sure that work-related travel, purchasing and other day-to-day
concerns are taken care of smoothly and professionally.

Dr. James Perlotto at the university health plan has been a very important
person in my life here. When I arrived, I was in very poor health, with asthma
that was out of control. Dr. Perlotto's aggressive coordination of my health
care is the reason I'm as healthy as I am today. He literally helped me
survive graduate school.

I am very lucky to have a family that has supported me all the way through
this process. My Connecticut cousins, William Kraus, Lynne Yeannakis, James
Kraus, Julie Kraus, Sylvia Sanders and Alice Hobolth ("Grammy") have provided
me with a family and support network in New Haven. Uncountable moral and 
financial support for my education has come from my parents, Howard and
Georgia Visser, as well as from my uncle, Richard Hilliker. My sister, 
Heather, has been my good friend an my closest confidant throughout graduate
school, despite our 800-mile separation. Finally, I am profoundly grateful to
my grandfather, Fred Froman, whose generosity towards his grandchildren in his
estate allowed me to pursue my education without ever having to worry about
where the tuition money was going to come from.
