§1.3 Neutron stars and x-ray bursters

If the remnant of stellar collapse has a mass greater than the Chandrasekhar
limit of 1.4 M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, the degeneracy
pressure from the electrons is not sufficient to prevent further gravitational
collapse. Collapse resumes until a density of approximately 10<sup>15</sup>
g⋅cm<sup>-3</sup> is reached, at which point the electrons and nuclei are
packed so closely and collide so frequently that the electrons fuse with
protons an "neutronize" the matter. For stellar masses in the range 1.4
M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span> &lt; M &lt; 1.8
M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, the remnant at roughly nuclear
density is held from further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure. If the
mass exceeds 1.8 M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, however, this
neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to prevent the star from
collapsing into a black hole [[Rolfs and Rodney
1988]](../bibliography/#rolfs).

In the collapse of a pre-supernova star (with r ≈ 1.5⋅10<sup>6</sup> km and a
rotational period of ≈ 30 days) to a neutron star (with r ≈ 150 km), the
conservation of angular momentum leaves the remnant with a period of only ≈ 30
msec. (If the neutron star is accreting material from a companion, it may be
further spun up by the additional angular momentum gained with the infalling
material.) These rapidly spinning neutron stars are observed as pulsars in the
visible and/or radio wavelengths. A famous example is the pulsar at the center
of the Crab Nebula (SN1054), which pulses at 30 Hz in both radio and visible
light.

The large amount of energy imparted to the infalling material by the strong
gravitational field also causes x-ray emission. Many point sources of x-rays
in the spiral arms of our galaxy are thought to be neutron stars. Neutron
stars in close binary systems may occasionally be sites for thermonuclear
explosions similar in principle to novae. These explosions are thought to be
what we observe as "x-ray bursters". Astronomers observe sudden (≈ 1 sec)
increases by an order of magnitude or more in x-ray intensity, which take
seconds or minutes to decay back down to normal levels.

The gravitational field of a neutron star is thought to be too strong for
x-ray bursters to enrich the interstellar medium with their ashes.
Astrophysicists are, however, interested in being able to accurately model the
observable properties of x-ray bursters, such as the observed x-ray flux as a
function of time. The risetime and peak luminosity of the light curve are
dependent on the energy generation of the x-ray burster, which is dependent in
large part on nuclear reactions. Energy generation is limited to approximately
10<sup>14</sup> erg⋅g<sup>-1</sup>⋅s<sup>-1</sup> in the CNO cycles by waiting
point nuclei, independent of temperature. In order for the observed
luminosities to be reproduced, greater amounts of energy are needed. One
possible path to greater energy generation is "breakout" through
<span class="nowrap"><sup>15</sup>O(α,γ)</span> [[Weischer Görres et al.
1999]](../bibliography/#weischer).

The purpose, then, of the measurement made in this thesis, is to better
understand the reaction rates of
<span class="nowrap"><sup>15</sup>O(α,γ)</span>,
<span class="nowrap"><sup>18</sup>F(p,γ)</span> and
<span class="nowrap"><sup>18</sup>F(p,α)</span>. The next chapter will
introduce the mathematical formalism for calculating the dependencies of these
reaction rates on the properties of isolated, narrow resonances in
<sup>19</sup>Ne. Then it will review the recent literature to give the latest
information on the known or calculated resonance properties. The rest of the
chapters will be devoted to describing the experiments which we have recently
carried out and their results, and to interpreting those results.
