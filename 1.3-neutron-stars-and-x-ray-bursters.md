§1.2 Neutron stars and x-ray bursters
=====================================

<blockquote>
<p>If our bodies were packed as solidly as the atomic nuclei they contain, our
	masses would increase by ten trillion times, and each of us would have
	more mass than Mount Everest.

If the remnant of stellar collapse has a mass greater than the Chandrasekhar
limit of 1.4 M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, the degeneracy
pressure from the electrons is not sufficient to prevent further gravitational
collapse. Collapse resumes until a density of approximately 10<sup>15</sup>
g⋅cm<sup>-3</sup> is reached, at which point the electrons and nuclei are
packed so closely and collide so frequently that the electrons fuse with
protons an "neutronize" the matter. For stellar masses in the range 1.4
M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span> &lt; M &lt; 1.8
M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, the remnant at roughly nuclear
density is held from further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure. If the
mass exceeds 1.8 M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, however, this
neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to prevent the star from
collapsing into a black hole [[Rolfs and Rodney
1988]](../bibliography/#rolfs).
