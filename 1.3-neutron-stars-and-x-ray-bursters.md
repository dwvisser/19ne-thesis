§1.3 Neutron stars and x-ray bursters
=====================================

If the remnant of stellar collapse has a mass greater than the Chandrasekhar
limit of 1.4 M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, the degeneracy
pressure from the electrons is not sufficient to prevent further gravitational
collapse. Collapse resumes until a density of approximately 10<sup>15</sup>
g⋅cm<sup>-3</sup> is reached, at which point the electrons and nuclei are
packed so closely and collide so frequently that the electrons fuse with
protons an "neutronize" the matter. For stellar masses in the range 1.4
M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span> &lt; M &lt; 1.8
M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, the remnant at roughly nuclear
density is held from further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure. If the
mass exceeds 1.8 M<span class="correction"><sub>☉</sub></span>, however, this
neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to prevent the star from
collapsing into a black hole [[Rolfs and Rodney
1988]](../bibliography/#rolfs).

In the collapse of a pre-supernova star (with r ≈ 1.5⋅10<sup>6</sup> km and a
rotational period of ≈ 30 days) to a neutron star (with r ≈ 150 km), the
conservation of angular momentum leaves the remnant with a period of only ≈ 30
msec. (If the neutron star is accreting material from a companion, it may be
further spun up by the additional angular momentum gained with the infalling
material.) These rapidly spinning neutron stars are observed as pulsars in the
visible and/or radio wavelengths. A famous example is the pulsar at the center
of the Crab Nebula (SN1054), which pulses at 30 Hz in both radio and visible
light.

The large amount of energy imparted to the infalling material by the strong
gravitational field also causes x-ray emission. Many point sources of x-rays
in the spiral arms of our galaxy are thought to be neutron stars. Neutron
stars in close binary systems may occasionally be sites for thermonuclear
explosions similar in principle to novae. These explosions are thought to be
what we observe as "x-ray bursters". Astronomers observe sudden (≈ 1 sec)
increases by an order of magnitude or more in x-ray intensity, which take
seconds or minutes to decay back down to normal levels.
