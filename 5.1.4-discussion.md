ยง5.1.4 Discussion
============================

Most of these resulting averages seem very reasonable. In general, it may be
observed that the Bayesian averages are not very different from the standard
averages. They are more conservative because
<span class="correction">of</span> the skepticism about the measurement error
bars introduced in the averaging procedure. All subsequent discussion will
refer to the results from the standard method of averaging.

The error bars on the present measurement represent a slight improvement over
the previously reported
<span class="nowrap"><sup>19</sup>Ne(<sup>3</sup>He,t)</span> coincidence
measurements [[Magnus, Smith et al. 1990](../bibliography/#magnus90); [Utku,
Ross et al. 1998](../bibliography/#utku)]. Recently reported measurements
through different reaction channels have already reported better precision,
though [[Bardayan, Blackmon et al. 2001](../bibliography/#bardayan01); [Rehm,
Wuosma et al. 2002](../bibliography/#rehm02); [Davids, van den Berg et al.
2003](../bibliography/#davids); [Rehm 2003](../bibliography/#rehm03)].
